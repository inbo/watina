\title{A variant of dplyr's collect() which converts dataframes to UTF-8 encoding
if OS is Windows}
\usage{
collect(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tbl}
}
\description{
Works as a simple \code{\link[dplyr:compute]{collect()}}, on which it is
based.
However, on a Windows OS the \code{collect()} function exported
by this package will convert character and factor
variables of dataframes to \code{UTF-8} encoding.
}
\details{
The functions in this package that \emph{collect} a \code{tbl_lazy} object,
e.g. when \code{collect = TRUE}, do so by using this function.
As a convenience to the user, the function is exported to allow manual
implementation.

The function \code{\link[=convertdf_enc]{convertdf_enc()}} is the workhorse
for the encoding conversion.
